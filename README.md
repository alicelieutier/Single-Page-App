# Single page app

This is a very basic template for a single page app. Developed while coaching at Makers to provide students with a starting point for their first Javascript apps.

### Run tests:
- open SpecRunner.html

### Run the app:
- open index.html

### Structure

`src/` should contain all the domain logic
`interface.js` contains interactions with the user
